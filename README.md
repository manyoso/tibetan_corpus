### Tibetan Language Parallel Corpus

This project is focused on creating a high quality tibetan language parallel corpus for use in automatic computer assisted machine translation.  The initial language focus will be translations from standard tibetan to standard english and wylie transliteration.

Scripts are written in Python to convert existing corpus documents into dictionary format and then into TMX (Translation Memory Exchange) format for input into statistical machine translation tools like Moses.

May whatever merit 
Gained by this task 
Accrue to the cause
For the liberation of all.
