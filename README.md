#### Tibetan Language Parallel Corpus

```I pay homage to my Spiritual Heroes: 
The Virtuous Teachers,
Practicing the Excellent Path,
Praised by the Wise.```

This project is focused on creating a high quality tibetan language parallel corpus for use in automatic computer assisted machine translation.  The initial language focus will be translations from standard tibetan to english and wylie transliteration.

```May whatever merit 
Gained by this task 
Accrue to the cause
For the liberation of all.```
